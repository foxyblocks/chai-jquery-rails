# Chai jQuery Rails

[chai-jquery](https://github.com/chaijs/chai-jquery) is a plugin for
[chai](http://chaijs.com/) that gives you jquery expectation helpers.

This is a simple gem that adds chai-jquery to the rails asset pipline.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    group :development, :test do
      gem 'chai-jquery-rails'
    end

And then execute:

    $ bundle


Then in your test files add a sprocket require statement:

  js: `//= require chai-jquery`

  coffeescript: `#= require chai-jquery`

This gem also depends on [chai](http://chaijs.com/) which in turn depends on
[mocha](http://mochajs.org/).
The best way to get those is with the
[konacha gem](https://github.com/jfirebaugh/konacha).

## Kudos

  blogging about how to write a gem that includes rails assets.
